- VISUAL AUTO TUNING - You can customize your car with various parts, such as mirrors, lights, bumpers, body kits, rims, vinyls, etc. Create a unique image of your car and show it off to other players.
- IMPROVED PERFORMANCE TUNING - You can fine tune your car to your needs by adjusting the suspension, springs, tyre pressure, wheel angle, engine, turbine pressure, gear box, brakes, locking differential, etc. You can show some quality drift only if you have your car fine tuned to your needs.
- THE MOST TRUE TO LIFE RACING ON A MOBILE PLATFORM - You can enjoy the improved steering control that is perfect for quick side changing, backwards and drift donuts.
