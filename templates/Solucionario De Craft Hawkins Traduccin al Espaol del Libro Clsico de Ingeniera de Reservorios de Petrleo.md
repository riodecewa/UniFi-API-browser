The book Applied Petroleum Reservoir Engineering was first published in 1959 by B. C. Craft and M. F. Hawkins, who were both professors of petroleum engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. The book was one of the first textbooks to introduce the material balance equation and its applications to reservoir engineering. The book also covered topics such as fluid flow, well testing, water influx, and enhanced oil recovery. The book was widely used and adopted by many universities and companies around the world.
 
The book has been revised and updated several times to reflect the changes and advances in the petroleum industry. The second edition was published in 1991 by B. C. Craft, M. F. Hawkins, and R. E. Terry, who added new chapters on reservoir simulation and decline curve analysis. The third edition was published in 2014 by R. E. Terry and J. B. Rogers, who incorporated new technologies and methods such as hydraulic fracturing, horizontal wells, and reservoir management. The third edition also used Microsoft Excel with VBA to simplify and automate the calculations.
 
The book is organized into 12 chapters that cover the following topics: introduction to reservoir engineering; rock and fluid properties; material balance equation; single-phase fluid flow; gas reservoirs; water influx; oil recovery mechanisms and the material balance equation; prediction of primary recovery of oil reservoirs; enhanced oil recovery; well testing; analysis of production data; reservoir management. Each chapter includes objectives, key terms, examples, exercises, problems, and references. The book also provides appendices with useful data and formulas.
